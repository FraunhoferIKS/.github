Safe Intelligence — this forms the core brand of the <b>Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS</b>. Connected cognitive systems drive innovation in many sectors, for example in autonomous vehicles, medical devices or intelligent automation within industry. They should always take full advantage of the potential offered by artificial intelligence, while remaining demonstrably safe and reliable at the same time. This is why Fraunhofer IKS researches both artificial intelligence and software engineering — we consider resilience and intelligence as part of the same process.
